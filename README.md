# MyCodeOurPain Repository

This repo contains all my submissions/uploads for the #MyCodeOurPain initiative. 

Welcome to **MyCodeOurPainRepo** — a collection of weird bugs, edge cases, and coding mysteries I’ve run into while building real-world projects.

In an age where Copilot writes half your code and ChatGPT answers confidently with the same answer it gave before (which you already told wasn't working 😭), I wanted to bring back that old-school debugging energy — where devs help each other make sense of the chaos.

Each folder in this repo contains self-contained issues I've encountered.

---


## Each folder includes:
- A short description of the problem
- A minimal reproducible example
- (Sometimes) my working theory or what finally fixed it

## 🧵 Part of a Bigger Thing

This repo is part of a public learning and debugging initiative to bring back the joy of coding and problem-solving together.
